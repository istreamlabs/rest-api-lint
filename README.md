# REST API Linting Action

A Docker image with opinionated REST API linting for iStreamPlanet. Supports GitHub Actions.

## Usage

There are two recommended ways to use this:

1. GitHub Actions
2. Any system that supports Docker images

### GitHub Actions Example

Set up a workflow that uses this image to do API linting and you are done:

```yaml
on: [push]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: Build & Test
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v1
      - name: API Lint
        uses: istreamlabs/rest-api-lint@master
        with:
          filename: path/to/openapi.yaml
```

The path you pass should be relative to the checkout directory, which is automatically mounted in the container and becomes the working directory.

### Docker Example

While similar to the above, you will need to do an extra step when using Docker directly. You must ensure that the working directory gets mounted properly into the container.

```sh
# Create the image.
$ docker build -t rest-api-lint .

# Mount the current working directory to `/tmp` in the container and run linting.
$ docker run -it -v $(pwd):/tmp rest-api-lint:latest /tmp/my-openapi.yaml
```

The command will return a `0` on success and a `1` if any errors are found. Warnings do not trigger a failure.

### Exceptions & Overrides

When [stoplightio/spectral#747](https://github.com/stoplightio/spectral/issues/747) gets fixed you will be able to provide individual exceptions on a case-by-case basis.

To disable an entire rule, e.g. to support a legacy API, you can provide your own `.spectral.yaml` file in the root of your repo which sets some rules to `false`. Note that this disables the rule for the _entire file_:

```yaml
rules:
  iso8601: false
  server-version: false
```

It's also possible to set it to `warn`

The `extends` field is automatically added (or appended to) by the linter script to inject the iSP ruleset into your config.
